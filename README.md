# Is pepito home?

Runs [ispepitohome.com](https://ispepitohome.com).

I made this while slightly inebriated.

I run `updateServer.js` on a little box in my home. It checks if the site is up to date with the latest [Pepito](https://twitter.com/PepitoTheCat) tweets, and if not starts a github workflow that updates the page.
